      <h2>delivery and timing</h2>
      <p>We will meet once a week in person for two hours and forty minutes in the Art and Design Building. The classes are required and during our sessions we will discuss work, complete demos, and further our design knowledge. The class is scheduled to run for 16 weeks and you can expect to work for 6 hours outside of class each week.</p>
      <h2>prerequisites</h2>
      <p>AVT 311: Graphic Design Principles and Methods</p>
      <h2>course description</h2>
      <p>This course explores long-form print graphic design. While our focus will be on books and publications, the skills developed—creating engaging design within a branded, organized and inviting structure, presenting information in various content-appropriate formats, developing a visual identity and finding and creating effective imagery is also applicable to other common design tasks—annual reports, ad campaigns, business collateral, newspapers, websites, books, exhibition design, branding systems, and other commonly produced documents. Design is a tool for persuading, informing, and entertaining. In this class you will be required to do all three.</p>
      <p>The primary intent of this course is the development of conceptual, typographical, and print design skills. It is a fundamental expectation that students will rise to the challenge of mastering the technical skills they need to achieve an effective and visually and typographically literate outcome. While learning software is not the goal of this class, increased software (or digital craft) skills are the byproduct of (and evidence for) a successful outcome.</p>
      <h2>objectives</h2>
      <ul class="arrow">
        <li>introduce students to editorial and periodical publication design.</li>
        <li>demonstrate fluency in the visual vocabulary and technical skills relevant to editorial design</li>
        <li>enhance written, visual, and oral presentation techniques</li>
        <li>continue development of professional computer design skills in page layout, and image manipulation using Adobe CC software.</li>
        <li>improve typographic skills</li>
        <li>gain knowledge of production techniques</li>
        <li>understand the process of designing publications</li>
        <li>apply graphic design principles in the ideation, development, and production  of visual messages.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>content</h2>
      <p>This course consists of three projects, weekly exercises, and in class discussions and demos. The demos and discussions are to begin to familiarize students with specific concepts and ideas and the projects are a synthesis of the concepts and ideas we will cover. Weekly prompts will encourage you to critically engage with publication design you encounter outside of class.</p>
      <h2>projects</h2>
      <h3>Project 1: Book Design</h3>
      <p>In collaboration with <a href="https://www.stillhousepress.org/">Stillhouse Press</a>, students will create a design for a to be published book. Students will design the interior and exterior of the book using a provided manuscript.</p>
      <h3>Project 2: Editorial Feature</h3>
      <p>Students will create curate a selection of articles and make a mini magazine that includes the cover, table of contents, and articles.</p>
      <h3>Project 3: Event Calendar</h3>
      <p>Students will create a doubled sided mailer that showcase upcoming events for an arts based organization. The project will be a culmination of the skills and concepts you have learned throughout this course.</p>
      <h2>discussion of work</h2>
      <p>You will need to take an active role in both the presentation and discussion of your work. We will review projects in a variety of ways and you are expected to be able to talk and write about your own work and give feedback to your peers about their work. The ability to discuss your work and other student’s work is a very important part of your education at Mason. Use this class to improve on those skills.</p>
      <h2>communication</h2>
      <p>Your ability to communicate with me is of prime importance in this course. If you are going to be absent, late, or not have your work, it will be your best interest in communicating those things to me in advance. I do not need to know your reasons for being absent, late, or not having your work but I do need to know. A simple, short email will be fine.</p>
      <p>The same goes for if you are struggling in this class or having other issues that are hindering your ability to complete work in this class. The more you keep me in the loop the more I can help you and adjust as needed.</p>
      <h2>attendance policy</h2>
      <p>Four absenses, regardless of excuse, will be an automatic failure of the class. After the first absence, each class you miss will lower your engagement grade by 25 points unless you let me know you won't be in class before class and make an effort to cover what you missed in class. After the first late arrival, each class you are late to will lower your engagement grade by 10 points unless you let me know you are going to be late before class. Exceptions to this policy are for people actively communicating with me about what is happening.</p>
      <h2>engagement</h2>
      <p>Your engagement in this class will affect your final grade (and, by extension, the quality of your work) for this course. Your attendance is tied to this grade along with your ability to actively take part in this course in the following ways.</p>
      <ul class="arrow">  
        <li>Attend class meetings and be on time.</li>
        <li>Create things and be prepared to show them on time.</li>
        <li>Make things thoughtfully, intentionally, and with intensity.</li>
        <li>Meet all deadlines for handing in work and process.</li>
        <li>Actively participate in critiques both in class and out of class.</li>
        <li>Be curious about making things and the things your classmates make.</li>
        <li>Care about yourself & your work, your classmates & their work, and this class.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>grading</h2>
      <p>Grades will be based on engagement (25%), exercises (25%) and projects (50%).</p>
      <h3>engagement (25%)</h3>
      <p>This percentage will be based on your engagement in the class which is explained on above. Attend class and be engaged in this course and its content throughout the semester and this should be an easy 25%.</p>
      <h3>exercises (25%)</h3>
      <p>The exercises are meant to be quicker, skill building tasks that improve your projects and design knowledge.</p>
      <h3>projects (50%)</h3>
      <p>Each project will generate two different grades. One grade will be based on your week to week process and the second grade will be based on the final submission. At the end of the semester you will have 6 total project grades that are all weighted equally for this 50%.</p>
      <h2>late work</h2>
      <p>Late work will be accepted for three weeks after a deadline with the exception of the final project which will be due at the end of the semester. There is a section on the rubrics showing how late work is factored into the assignment grade.</p>
      <h2>rubrics</h2>
      <p>Rubrics are used to grade exercises, projects, and checkpoints. The rubrics are in the PDF syllabus and tied to each submission on Canvas. The rubrics are here to allow you to understand how work is graded and to reference while working to self-evaluate.</p>
      <h2>schedule</h2>
      <p>Most days we will meet for the entire time but some weeks we will have individual meetings or end early. Some classes will be work days so make sure to bring things to work on each class. Unless otherwise specified, all work is due at the beginning of class.</p>
      <p>A note—Time management is an important skill to master and should be worked on all your classes. Staying up all night working is not a badge of honor, it typically means you didn’t budget your time correctly. Staying up all night isn’t healthy and making sure you are keeping yourself healthy is your first priority.</p>
